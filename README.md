## What you'll find in here: ##

The original artwork, animations, and Flash source for the facial customizations
and wardrobe options in Glitch.

## What is not included ##

The server-side code that turned all of the avatar configurations into the
sprites used by the game.

The <a href="http://github.com/tinyspeck/glitch-client">glitch-client</a> 
repository contains the original implementation of the Vanity and Wardrobe. If
you're trying to figure out how all these things work together, it may be a 
useful resource to you!
